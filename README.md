# SuperBowlWinFactors
- Some analysis and Logistic Regression to determine links between record and SB victories. Started simply, with win ratio, but want to eventually work on adding in other factors as well. 

# Ways to contribute
- Want to eventually incorporate all season stats. 
- Should be able to look at shifted data to use last season's results to predict on current season's playoffs. 
- Should be able to use current regular season stats to predict playoff performance. 
- Want to add vector representation for roster and be able to capture differences in rosters, with more weight given to losing/gaining star players.
